The Qubic Ambassador Program is a global initiative aimed at building local communities that are passionate about Qubic. They are our boots on the ground. Qubican's (ambassadors) lead on expanding Qubic's global reach by organising local events, educating local communities, and contributing to the growth of the Qubic ecosystem by integrating more closely with the ecosystem, marketing and operation teams. At this the program has over 120 active ambassadors and over 3k members across the globe
To further professionalize and scale the ambassador program into targeted ecosystem areas, we're proposing a CCF request to fund Season 4 of the Qubican program. This season, the program aims to professionalize existing communities (with more training) and expand into new territories (Singapore, Taiwan, LATAM and Canada).
The season covers a period of 2 months with a possible extension if the Qubic price further appreciates.

S3 Challenges & learnings
Some communities had challenges to further grow their communities in members (USA and Spain), a new growth approach is required. The USA will be closely supported by Raziah to achieve its community potential. For Spain, El_Clip will be closer involved as an advisor.
We departed with the Turkish Ambassador Community as it was very challenging to work together with the community leads. The language barrier, spending of funds, differences in planning and differences in claim of rewards originated to this decision. We will revisit - the opportunity to hire new CL's for Turkey after season 4 as the opportunity in the Turkish market is huge.
We had more incidents than ever with ambassadors that were not following the ethical guidelines of the ambassador program. We rolled out a new Code of Conduct for all ambassadors that clearly states what is expected of ambassadors and what set of responsibilities = their role as ambassador brings. As we scale, we need to continue to educate and show ambassadors how good (behavior and impact) looks like.
Budget



Funds are allocated to communities on a monthly basis. We only provide funding after the agreed progression has been achieved. We will provide monthly reporting to the community in the #ambassador channel.
The overall increase in comparison with season 3 is about $4k (total $55k in S03). In comparison to season 3, we're onboarding 4 new communities. All these locations are strategically important locations for Qubic if we are to grow the network and support T1 listing (USA and South East Asia).
The expenses can be tracked here through publicly available wallets broken down by local communities too. Community Leads will own their finances but Kimz, Raziah, Drac, Jort and Talentnodes form a finance committee to make sure funding is well spent.

Any funds that are left will be either carried over to the next ambassador program season or transferred back directly to the CCF.
Benchmark with other ambassador programs
Ambassador Programs are popular in crypto and are funded differently depending on the size of the project and number of ambassadors. Ecosystems pushing for rapid global expansion now earmark $200 k-$500 k in stablecoins or liquid tokens per quarter. In 2025, Solana Superteam funded 500k a year. LunarStorm announced a 1M rewards sprint. The most important take away is that budgets scale with the community size and GTM goals.
Governance
The Qubican program is run by some of Qubics biggest contributors. We call them Community Leads. Together they form the Qubican Quorum. Program decisions are made by Quorum. Local Community decisions are made by the Community Leads together with their workgroups. Anyone can apply to start a local community as long as the requirements are met. Below an overview of the current governance structure.
Ambassadors earn rewards by completing tasks for their community, such as creating content, newsletters, videos, organizing events, helping the ecosystem/marketing teams or other things that help growt the Qubic ecosystem. Program Managers and Community Leads are paid a monthly compensation, depending on the impact they had. Their impact is measured through the KPI's mentioned above.
Talentnodes, Retrodrive and Alber are not paid and act as liaisons for the Community Leads and ambassadors.
