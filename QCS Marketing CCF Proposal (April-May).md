# Financial Reports Can Be Found Here:

- **From Jan – March:** [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NQfzfmqHJOxStRm6k6l9hrg21nFGdFj--ezKtmJ8AdU/edit?usp=sharing)  
- **From April onward:** All expenses can be tracked on [https://q-c-s.com/](https://q-c-s.com/)

The [previous funding proposal](https://github.com/Zgirt/QCS-Budget-Q12025/blob/a3446e0/README.md) was approved in epoch 145. QCS received **276 bln QUBIC** from the CCF. This amount, initially estimated to cover QCS running costs for February to April, was not enough to cover the month of April due to fluctuating market prices. Since some team members and partners receive payment in QUBIC, some workgroups (Marketing & Operations) had to delay payments to the next funding round.

## QCS Overview

Qubic Core Services (QCS) is requesting funds from the Computor Control Fund (CCF) to fund running costs like salaries and to fund activities for Marketing, Ecosystem Development, Community Management, Strategy, Finance, and Operations.

While the requested budgets are presented as separate proposals for clarity and administrative purposes, it is important to note that these components are interdependent and are designed to function cohesively. The effectiveness and intended outcomes of the budget request can only be achieved when these budgets are considered and executed collectively with other business units.

**The requested funding will be allocated to:**
- Settle outstanding payments for March 2025.

## QCS 2025 Milestone Tracker: Progress Through the Year

QCS success indicators are determined by the published [roadmap](https://qubic.org/roadmap) and Qubic milestones. Each individual workgroup discusses its successes and learnings in the section below the milestone summary.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/872f83bb-dfd7-4273-825b-e136b2fb68cc)


### Summary Highlights

- Daily Active Users (DAU) increased significantly, from an average of 3.5K to 6K. This is especially impressive considering we did not yet have user-facing interfaces for key applications like QX throughout the entire quarter.  
- The ratio of active wallets to holder wallets has shown stronger growth on the holder side. As more dApps are launched, we expect the number of active wallets to increase throughout Q2.  
- We anticipated reaching $10M in average daily trading volume. At peak, we achieved over $50M in a single day. However, due to the declining price action, we averaged $6M daily, falling short of our target.  
- Qubic also set a goal of achieving $30M in average TVL. We ultimately averaged $22.2M, largely due to price performance and the early-stage maturity of the ecosystem.  
- Qubic delivered three IPOs and dApps in Q1: QVault, Qubicbay, and MSVault. With four IPOs planned for Q2, we are confident in exceeding our quarterly goals. Additionally, we aim to launch Nevtrace, a powerful integration that allows Qubic to connect with any application via a visual “Make” interface — enabling complex workflows without writing a single line of code. Beyond that, two more applications are in preparation for potential IPOs: a B2AI application leveraging Qubic’s new MPC protocol for AI and a decentralized funding platform focused on NGO-driven projects.  
- In terms of ecosystem growth, Qubic overachieved on partnership goals in Q1. Strategic partnerships were signed with Alastria and the Comunidad de Madrid, helping Qubic sponsor MadHack and attract top talent. We partnered with Qatum to onboard large-scale mining facilities. Onyze joined as a custodian partner to facilitate institutional onboarding. We also finalized a strategic partnership with Certik for auditing and security. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect to sign at least five more major agreements, including: a top blockchain-based data and research company, more DEX aggregators, AI research institutions and additional Layer 1 and Layer 2 protocol integrations.  


If we were able to exceed some of our most ambitious goals during a quarter of price decline, we are extremely confident that with the foundation now in place, Q2 will bring significantly higher DAU on-chain and improved performance across all key metrics.

## Key Takeaway

**"We built the base. Now we scale."**  


QCS overdelivered on several key initiatives during a challenging quarter — the hardest part is behind us. With a strong pipeline and increasing ecosystem maturity, Q2 is poised to deliver exponential growth across users, usage, and integrations.

## QCS Marketing | Q1 TL;DR

In Q1, Qubic Marketing drove strong gains in visibility and engagement—especially in key markets like the U.S.—validating ecosystem interest and brand relevance. However, flatlined blog engagement, weak retention, and underutilized CTAs revealed gaps in depth and conversion. These insights informed a refined Q2 strategy focused on quality over quantity: reducing agency spend by bringing expertise in-house, replatforming marketing ops, sharpening audience-specific messaging, and building clear onramps for developers, partners, and investors. It’s important to emphasize that without QCS-led Marketing, Qubic has no external "face"—no clear narrative—for prospective investors, partners, or enterprises. This function is essential to shaping perception, signaling growth, and translating technical progress into ecosystem expansion. With stronger structure, segmentation, and a $100K/month budget request (50% operational run rate + 50% Special Projects/Programs Shipped), QCS Marketing is now positioned to scale Qubic’s credibility, adoption, and strategic impact across enterprise AI, Web3, and retail audiences to drive growth and liquidity.

## Q1 Marketing Summary: Foundation Set, Strategy Refined

**[Link to In-Depth Q1 Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-ZMMpXl7QUQ957KQDl2k523nsirqMFud/view)**

### Ecosystem Visibility Grew, But Depth Fell Short
We saw meaningful growth in U.S. market traction, social visibility (10x reposts, 30% X growth), and video engagement (80%+ increase in watch time). These wins validated Qubic’s brand relevance and unlocked new channels for ecosystem expansion — but content retention and user journey depth lagged, signaling a gap in conversion and clarity.

### Strategic Messaging Resonated, Yet Required Greater Precision
High-performing posts like AiGarth explainers and People’s Network content showed strong appetite for Qubic-native innovation stories. However, core site behavior and blog skim rates highlighted the need to shift from reach to resonance — refining messaging to serve specific audience needs (builders, investors, analysts, scientists).

### Operational Gaps Revealed Opportunities for Scale
While content campaigns landed, fragmented execution (limited CTAs, weak funneling, underperforming site UX) exposed inefficiencies in our digital presence. These issues directly impact QCS goals tied to adoption, growth, and product visibility — and justify the need for a structured replatforming and improved role clarity.

### New Strategy Aligns with Execution Readiness
Q2 will shift from visibility to value. With a refined plan in place, Qubic Marketing will replatform its ops, launch branded positioning campaigns, and build onramps tailored to AI, Web3, and retail stakeholders. This includes the hiring of a U.S.-focused Growth Lead, deeper content segmentation, and targeted outreach — all in service of ecosystem growth, investor confidence, and real-world AI adoption.

## QCS Marketing Strategy

For Q2, Qubic's growth marketing will focus on enhancing real-world utility, driving adoption and attracting investment through the following initiatives:

- **Adoption in Web3, AI, Research & Academia**: Position Qubic as essential infrastructure across sectors by showcasing its high-performance, decentralized AI compute capabilities.  
- **Development of Killer Applications**: Encourage the creation of decentralized applications (DApps) that leverage Qubic's unique features—such as feeless transactions and rapid smart contract execution—to offer solutions that outperform centralized alternatives.  
- **Seamless Integration**: Simplify the onboarding process for developers and enterprises by providing comprehensive integration guides and support, facilitating the adoption of Qubic's decentralized computing solutions.  
- **Increase Verifiable Activity**: Boost network utilization by promoting the growth of AI training tasks and other computational activities, thereby demonstrating Qubic's economic vitality and the practical value of its infrastructure.

These strategies aim to solidify Qubic's position as a leader in decentralized AI computing and expand its adoption across various sectors. Please refer to the Plan-on-a-Page below.
