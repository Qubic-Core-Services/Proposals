- Timed to capitalize on market momentum and planned announcements.
- The campaign includes Cointribune, Cointelegraph, The Block, CoinGecko, Top-Tier Influencer co-hosted AMAs, and targeted ads.
- Success is measured by hitting at least 2 out of 4 KPIs by June 30.
- Vote YES to activate a focused, high-leverage outreach push during this prime window.

## Why Now?

### Active Window

- The next 4-8 weeks are a rare window of high engagement before the summer slowdown. Now is the time to capture attention from builders, investors, and the broader crypto community.

### Launch Alignment

- We’re rolling out multiple products: Qubic Academy, Vottun Bridge, Nostromo Launch Pad, and the Tickchain Podcast. Each one builds momentum, so the timing of this campaign is critical.

### Press & Promotion

- Media coverage needs at least 48 hours' lead time. To hit those cycles and maximize exposure, we need to lock in the budget now.

### Act Fast

- Securing resources today ensures every launch lands with visibility, reach, and the compounding impact this moment deserves.
