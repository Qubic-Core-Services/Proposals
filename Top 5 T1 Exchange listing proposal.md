- If the community decides **not** to proceed, the funds will be returned to the CCF.  
- If the USD value of the funds is higher at the time of payment, the surplus will be returned to the CCF. If it is lower, it will be required to find alternatives such as donations
- For conversion to USDT, priority will be given to OTC sales with existing requests, otherwise, a TWAP sale will be used.
- This exchange is not allowed in the US by now
