Also, we want to highlight that Ecosystem Services managed to extend its activity for 1 extra month. This is due to a cost efficiency strategy (including pausing hiring process) and a slight price increase during the period. Please note that below table does not include funds dedicated to other events not covered in the initial proposal (such as AI for good, which was funded separately).
