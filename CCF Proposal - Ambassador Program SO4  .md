The Qubic Ambassador Program is a global initiative aimed at building local communities that are passionate about Qubic. They are our boots on the ground. Qubican’s (ambassadors) lead on expanding Qubic’s global reach by organising local events, educating local communities, and contributing to the growth of the Qubic ecosystem by integrating more closely with the ecosystem, marketing and operation teams. At this the program has over 120 active ambassadors and over 3k members across the globe  
To further professionalize and scale the ambassador program into targeted ecosystem areas, we’re proposing a CCF request to fund Season 4 of the Qubican program. This season, the program aims to professionalize existing communities (with more training), expand into new territories (Singapore, Taiwan, LATAM and Canada) and introduce the Qubic Creator Fund. The Qubic Creator Fund is a new program managed by the Ambassador Program, with a focus to onboard and reward even more top content creators. The current structure doesn’t scale for existing ambassadors and doesn't reward entrepreneurship from creators who seek funding for multi-week campaigns.  

The season covers a period of 3 months with a possible extension if the Qubic price further appreciates.

## Who are Qubicans and what are their Season 4 Objectives
Qubic Ambassadors (Qubicans) are passionate individuals from around the globe that help grow the Qubic ecosystem. There are three distinct types of ambassador roles, each contributing to the ecosystem in a unique way:  
- **Qubican Community Leaders** – Lead the local community, manage the local treasury, local strategy and Discord. They also take the lead to organise local meetups, conferences, workshops, and (virtual) events to engage and expand Qubic's presence in your area.  
- **Qubican Ambassadors** – are members of local Qubican communities and are organized in workgroups that complete specialized tasks like content creation, community management, partnership/investor introductions and more. Ambassadors can have both technical and non-technical backgrounds.  
- **Qubican Contributors** - are members of local Qubic communities but who still need to earn their stripes.  

**Program Managers:** Raziah, Kimz  
**Community Leads:** Seb, Raziah (France), Kimz (Nomad), SpaceCaddet, NFT Ronnie, Evandon (USA), Drac, Jort (Spain), Emmanuel, Xxodux (Nigeria), Marty, MDC (Germany), Xingyuan (China, Chinuk, Kavatak, German (Russia), Arya, Tien Binfort (Vietnam), Ddalki, Lee (South Korea), Tendou (Japan)  

**To-be Onboarded Communities:** Singapore, Taiwan, Argentina, Brazil (LATAM), Canada, Thailand (Optional)  

Community Leads together form a “quorum” that collectively votes on key-decisions and the direction of the ambassador program.  

### The ambassador program will focus on achieving 4 objectives in Season 4:
- Community Expansion & Maturity: strengthen current and new communities (USA, South Korea, China,Vietnam and Japan) and launch new ones in important strategic locations in Asia (Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan), Canada and LATAM.  
- Functional Integration with Core Teams: continue to train Community Leads and selected ambassadors to support ecosystem and marketing teams locally with different tasks.  
- Roll-out Qubic Creator Fund: roll-out of the Qubic Creator Fund to incentive and fund a larger group of creators, retain top performers and reward entrepreneurial energy.  
- Local Events & Hackathons: Empower regions to run self-managed IRL impact initiatives

- We onboarded 6 new community leads that actively lead and coordinate local Qubic communities in Asia.  
- Creation of three new communities: Vietnam (1100+ members), South Korea (142 members) and Japan.  
- Train the trainer Community leads on Qubic technicals, mining foundations and ecosystem development.  
- Delivered an incubated project as part of the Qubic incubator program.  
- Chinese community has grown to be ++200 members in QQ, providing mining educational content in Chinese.  
- France, China, USA connected with several developer communities to create future projects on Qubic  
- Over 15mln impressions across our X posts, across all communities.

## Challenges & learnings
- Some communities had challenges to further grow their communities in members (USA and Spain), a new growth approach is required. The USA will be closely supported by Raziah to achieve its community potential. For Spain, El_Clip will be closer involved as an advisor.  
- We departed with the Turkish Ambassador Community as it was very challenging to work together with the community leads. The language barrier, spending of funds, differences in planning and differences in claim of rewards originated to this decision. We will revisit - the opportunity to hire new CL’s for Turkey after season 4 as the opportunity in the Turkish market is huge.  
- The financial incentives were not impactful enough, resulting in some complains and some ambassadors making individual CCF requests (of which most got rejected). With the introduction of the Qubic Creator Fund, we believe we can fix that issue.  
- We had more incidents than ever with ambassadors that were not following the ethical guidelines of the ambassador program. We rolled out a new Code of Conduct for all ambassadors that clearly states what is expected of ambassadors and what set of responsibilities = their role as ambassador brings. As we scale, we need to continue to educate and show ambassadors how good (behavior and impact) looks like.  

---

## How will we spend the funds in season 4?
- Community Expansion & Maturity:  
  Launch and support 4 new regional chapters Singapore, Taiwan, Argentina and Canada (Thailand optional), including onboarding and activation by recruiting local leads, provide chapter starter kits, and activate communities via Zealy quests and Telegram missions.  
  Organization of Qubic Asia and North America to establish a “low cost” roadmap to maximize visibility, participation in local events and support local marketing during T1 listing events.  
  Prioritize a strong presence in USA now that Qubic is closer than ever to USA listings. Emphasis on attending several events and organizing multiple meet-ups across the country.  
  Signing collaborations with several universities in North America and South East Asia to enable students to create their own project with Qubic.  

- Pilot Launch Qubic Creator Fund  
  The Qubic Creator Fund is a program that aims to attract and reward Qubic creators for the real impact that they have on socials such as X and YouTube. It gives recognition and visibility to ambassadors who actively grow the Qubic brand. The program is there to ensure that rewards are fair, quality driven and reduces the lower fund request to CCF via its own fund. The creator fund consists out of two parts:  
  - Content Creator Program: threshold rewards for individuals who hit engagement/views/reshares goals on X and YouTube.  
  - Mini grants: creator grants for campaign ideas, when bigger impact needs bigger support.  

The Qubic Creator Fund is managed by the ambassador program. The approval of mini grants are decided by Talentnodes, two program managers, a community lead and three community representatives.  
This is a pilot and will iterate as we go while giving regular feedback reports to the community. We will uphold high standards while keeping it fair and transparent.

## Budget

<img width="600" height="412" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ceade4f-3f26-424d-a1ac-c70f05ef2296" />


Funds are allocated to communities on a monthly basis. We only provide funding after the agreed progression has been achieved. We will provide monthly reporting to the community in the #ambassador channel.  

The overall increase in comparison with season 3 is about $40k (total $55k in S03). The content creator fund and the mini grants add significantly to the budget ($37k) but as explained we believe that adding more funds with the purpose of content creation and providing funding for strategic marketing campaigns from the community, will lead to more success. In comparison to season 3, we‘re onboarding 4 new communities. All these locations are strategically important locations for Qubic if we are to grow the network and support T1 listing (USA and South East Asia).  

The ambassador program has proven its value in S1, S2 and S3. We believe that with this investment, timed with the bullrun, will lead to significantly more exploration and investors/developer interest in Qubic.  

The expenses can be tracked here through publicly available wallets broken down by local communities too. Community Leads will own their finances but Kimz, Raziah, Drac, Jort and Talentnodes form a finance committee to make sure funding is well spent.  

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eT8KuqquNSDpnTBXLWREgH2TCqxZusW5rxeOG5ruxw8/edit?usp=sharing  

Any funds that are left will be either carried over to the next ambassador program season or transferred back directly to the CCF.

## Benchmark with other ambassador programs
Ambassador Programs are popular in crypto and are funded differently depending on the size of the project and number of ambassadors. Ecosystems pushing for rapid global expansion now earmark $200 k-$500 k in stablecoins or liquid tokens per quarter. In 2025, Solana Superteam funded 500k a year. LunarStorm announced a 1M rewards sprint. The most important take away is that budgets scale with the community size and GTM goals.

## Governance
The Qubican program is run by some of Qubics biggest contributors. We call them Community Leads.  Together they form the Qubican Quorum. Program decisions are made by Quorum. Local Community decisions are made by the Community Leads together with their workgroups. Anyone can apply to start a local community as long as the requirements are met. Below an overview of the current governance structure.  
Ambassadors can earn compensation by completing Zealy tasks, by helping their local communities or by successfully applying for a mini grant as part of the Qubic Creator Program. Both Program Managers and Community Leads are paid a monthly compensation, depending on the impact they had. Their impact is measured through the KPI’s mentioned above.  

Talentnodes, Retrodrive and Alber are not paid and act as liaisons for the Community Leads and ambassadors.
