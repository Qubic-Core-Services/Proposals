# QCS Budget and Operations FAQ

Below is a compiled list of community questions and corresponding answers regarding the recent QCS budget proposals, cost-cutting measures, workgroup structure, and ongoing initiatives.

---

## Q: How and where did you cut costs if the total requested funds are still the same?

**A**:  
- **Marketing Expenses**: We are requesting a \$100K budget for April and May respectively, to normalize a sustainable marketing run rate for QCS. This budget now clearly separates operational needs from additional project-based or campaign-specific spending.  
  - Included in this figure are **carry-over expenses** from March that were personally fronted. They **do not** reflect ongoing costs.  
  - We have **streamlined headcount** by reducing two full-time roles. The budget has been **reallocated** to specialized expertise focused on network growth, partnership development, and multi-channel storytelling.  
  - April’s primary focus is **brand and communications strategy refinement**, while May shifts to **execution**, requiring a one-time investment of **\$20K** and a predictable **\$2,600/month** commitment thereafter—**significantly lower** than the previous \$30K/month (~10% of the former run rate).  
  - With **marketing automation and forecasting** now in place, this budget reflects a **disciplined**, trust-building approach aimed at **scaling strategically** into Q3.

- **Ecosystem Expenses**: Although we need to pay full salaries for April, we’ve already implemented an **almost 50% cut** (\$25,000 for April). Two new hires will come at a significantly **lower cost**, and we intend to continue **minimizing expenses** as we have by securing sponsors for events.

- **Operational Expenses**: While these don’t decrease the overall budget directly, there are **pending legal/salary fees from March** carried over into April. Costs will **decrease from March into April and June**. 

To further increase transparency, we’ve created a **public Asana/Trello board** at [https://q-c-s.com/objectives](https://q-c-s.com/objectives) to track progress on **key catalysts/initiatives**. You can also see current priorities there. This page is **very new** and will be improved over time. Additionally, we maintain **expense dashboards** that are in continuous development.

## Q: What happens with QSwap?

**A**: They are entering the **testnet deployment** and **functional testing** phase. 

---

## Q: How did QCS decide to let people go? Is it possible that CD was let go because of KOL?

**A**: The members are leaving QCS for **varied reasons**, mostly related to **budget constraints** and **personal circumstances**. We thank **Bill**, **Aleish**, and **CryptoDeighs** for their contributions. Each **workgroup proposal** (Ecosystem and Marketing) outlines how the teams will move forward with restructured roles.

## Q: The Q1 marketing report seems good, but on the other hand I see Xcaliber is a paid member of QCS. If I recall correctly, I haven’t seen him active in the last 4-6 weeks. Was it for the KOL?

**A**: The **Marketing CCF proposal** is **forward-looking**. While we can’t predict the future with certainty, **Xcaliber** is part of the plan as one of several **social media contributors**. This role is contingent upon the proposal being approved.

## Q: Who are paid QCS members?

**A**: For the full list, please refer to the **QCS membership list** (linked within our internal proposals and organizational documentation).

## Additional Clarifications on Grants, Incubation, and Achievements

Some statements may underestimate the **ecosystem team’s work** on grants and incubation—likely due to **lack of direct exposure**. Here’s an overview of that process:

- **Grants and Incubation**:  
  - Projects require an **extensive selection process**, going beyond simple idea approval.  
  - We review and correct proposals, ensuring a **quality assurance** layer that covers man-hours, effort estimation, and milestone planning.  
  - When milestones are delivered, **QA** is performed on the outcomes. Projects failing to meet requirements are subject to committee votes for further action.  
  - **Onboarding** teams is another key responsibility. Drawing on our experience, we’ve refined these processes (e.g., for hackathon teams).

- **Project Management Office (PMO)**:  
  - We created a **PMO** at a **minimal cost** to oversee all active projects.  
  - A **bi-weekly report** is provided during the **All Hands** meeting, summarizing the status of each initiative.

## Q: Is XCcal paid?

**A**: The current **proposal is future-based** (apart from **past due** expenses stemming from the February/March hackathon).  
- **No new hires** or **agency services** have been incurred.  
- **No social media services** from **XCalibur** or other contractors have taken place yet, as everything hinges on whether the proposal is approved.  
- None of these plans will materialize **if the proposal does not pass**.
