## Qubic Marketing Plan  
*(April — June 2025)*

---

## 1. State of Qubic Marketing
- **Market Volatility**: Token price remains unstable → disciplined spend & global‑scale / local‑message balance is critical.  
- **Core Mandate**: Build trust, visibility, and momentum while aligning tightly with ecosystem milestones and the QCT roadmap.  
- **Focused Repositioning**: Present **Qubic** as *the backbone of decentralized AI, compute, and innovation* with simplified messaging and a cleaner web presence.  
- **Community Amplification**: Activate **Qubic Ambassadors** and the **Qubic International Collaborators Network (QUICN)** for global reach and local activations.  
- **Execution Rhythm**: Operate **bi‑weekly sprints** in four languages (EN/ES/FR/ZH) → *test → measure → report → learn* throughout Q2.  

---

## 2. Strategic Focus (May — June)

### 2.1 Simplify Messaging — *Clarify Audiences & Spark Conversation*
- Sharpen and unify the narrative around decentralized AI, compute, and real‑world use cases.  
- Standardize & simplify all public messaging touchpoints.  
- Lay a foundation for **organic content growth** at global scale.  

### 2.2 Build a Disciplined & International Marketing Engine
- **Bi‑weekly sprints** with clear deliverables.  
- Consistent, high‑quality weekly campaigns spotlighting shipped builds & partnerships.  
- Multilingual content streams: **Chinese, Spanish, French, English**.  

### 2.3 Execute Foundation & Campaigns
- **CertiK Speed Test** + continued **MadHack** video series.  
- Spotlight ecosystem wins (e.g., MLM projects, incubation successes).  
- Establish **Qubic Academy** presence; ship bi‑weekly campaigns aligned to roadmap (Vottun Bridge, QSwap, Nostromo, etc.).
