## **2- Challenges & Rationale for Stand‑Alone Request**

During the last 8 months Ecosystem team has faced several challenges, both internal and external, that have put at risk several of the commitments we have with the community. We aim to restructure our organization to offer greater transparency in all our activities and potential dependencies, so we can grow at a sustainable pace that ensures Qubic future mass adoption and success. Some of the challenges we are facing and our workaround/mitigation proposal

**Challenges**

- **Opacity**: Current grant committee decisions are invisible to miners and community, eroding trust. Currently, Grants Committee has a very low level of engagement, missing meetings and polls, which represents a severe bottleneck in project onboarding and execution.  
- **Quality Control:** Some projects experienced delays, missing milestone deadlines without public accountability with the community. Slippage goes unnoticed.  
- **Budget Flexibility:** Audits and project bursts need a ready supplier pool; current structure forces ad‑hoc begging.  
- **Onboarding Pain:** Teams struggle with launching their project in Qubic from the technical side given we lack proper technical documentation and support. We experienced large lead times in responses and even unattended requests, which means there are not enough tech resources available to assist community dev teams. This leads to QES directing QA to ensure deliverables meet Qubic standards  
- **Coordination Drag:** Being embedded in QCS ties us to unrelated politics, making it difficult to measure every team’s performance.

**Mitigation proposal**

- **Dissolve the private grants committee** and move approvals to an on‑chain wallet vote  
- Keep milestone QA private (QES) but publish pass/fail every two weeks (**public reporting process**).  
- **Monthly supplier budget** for audits, infra, or urgent partnerships. Big initiatives (e.g., events, tools for exchanges, future hackathons) will be requested as **separate proposals** so miners can approve or reject them explicitly.  
- **Operating model:** Since the introduction of the Project Management Office we were able to organise all Grants\&Incubation projects in a more industrialised way, keeping all devs coordinated and knowing what to do, which are the next steps (QA, payments...) and who to contact to in case of help. Also, this allowed us to create better reporting procedures, such as the bi-weekly report for the Grants Committee, to keep all stakeholders updated. Hence, we consider we have setup an operating model that is scalable and non-dependentent of high-seniority profiles, which allows us to move fast, being cost-efficient and flexible to adjusting our resources based on the projects we will have.

## **3- Deliverables and KPIs to evaluate QES success (May - July 2025\)**

| Deliverable | KPI (by 31 July 2025) |
| ----- | ----- |
| 3 Incubations Main‑Net | Vottun Bridge • Nostromo SC • QSwap— 3 tx hashes posted |
| Grant and incubation approvals → On‑chain vote | Voting dApp live, ≥ 200 voter wallets |
| Grant throughput | ≥ 5 grants reach Milestone 2 |
| New partnerships | ≥ 1 signed |
| Scientific paper | ≥ 1 new paper submitted to peer review |
| Transparency | 6 bi‑weekly spend \+ milestone reports (all). We will keep q-c-s portal transparency |
| Testnet | Run the public testnet and deploy 2 SC before they go into IPO for the community to test |

\*New deliverables will be joined to the roadmap that QCS and QCT has, any existing deliverables assigned to the ecosystem team now QES will be rolled into QES.

Dependencies: Launch dates assume incubation teams complete their own code and QA on schedule; QES unblocks but cannot write all code for them.

**7- Facts & Frequently‑Asked Questions**

Q 1\. Are you leaving QCS?

QES will operate financially independent (own budget, own reporting) but we will still work on a shared roadmap with QCS and QCT. Anything already assigned to “Ecosystem” automatically rolls into QES; future cross‑team tasks are coordinated.

Q 3\. Long‑term vision for QES?

- Enable any dev team to go from idea → audited main‑net launch with minimal friction.  
- Replace today’s “hand‑holding” with robust docs, boiler‑plates, and self‑serve tooling—so teams become fully autonomous.  
- Grow the builder funnel until most net‑new Qubic dApps originate outside core teams.  
- Provide the ecosystem growth and business leadership and execution  
- QES will evolve from a project incubation operating model (now), where we support all early-stage initiatives to setup and validate viability/desirability/feasibility, to a scale-up VC operating model, where we will act as funding partners for projects with already validated product market fit. Hence, QES will mature overtime, assuming more long-term strategic tasks rather than the operational ones that we are addressing   
- Elimination of territorial representatives. We will rely on ambassadors to cover the widest possible geographic area, as well as provide them with the necessary training to represent Qubic

Q 4\. Why is smart‑contract support such a big focus?

SC dev is the \#1 blocker we see (compile quirks, CLI confusion, audit gaps).  
The supplier budget lets us hire niche C++/Rust reviewers and pay for security audits on demand.  
Q 5\. Exchange listings—whose job?

Listings are not QES’ priority. We share intros, due‑diligence notes and collaborate with QCS (who already track token‑side BD).

This is a joint QES-QCS joint workstream. QES’s responsibility is to establish first contact, originate potential deals and support with due-diligence for listing while QCS, who already track token‑side BD, continues negotiations until closing the deal.

If a specific listing needs ecosystem fire‑power, we’ll raise a separate micro‑proposal so the community can decide.

Q 6\. How will you keep us in the loop?

	•	Weekly status post in \#QES showing: roadmap board,next‑week focus, blockers.  
	•	Bi‑weekly deep‑dive (same data \+ milestone QA results).  
	•	Open Q\&A thread under every report (24‑48 h response).  
	•	Private Discord workspace for incubations/grants to share code & get QA help—read‑only “observer” role available for computors who want to watch.  
Q 7\. What if we need a new hackathon or a new initiative?

In order to provide full transparency and the opportunity for Computors to decide where to spend funds, QES will be responsible to regularly identify new initiatives, such as Hackathons and Open Challenges, and draft a focused proposal (scope, costs, KPIs) so it can be voted. This way all initiatives can be measured independently. 

The base 97 Bln request only covers run‑the‑business ecosystem work.

Q 8\. Expenses of servers

1 testnet server for the public testnet which we will operate with help of QCT, and 3 testnet servers for team \+ solutions that are deployed
