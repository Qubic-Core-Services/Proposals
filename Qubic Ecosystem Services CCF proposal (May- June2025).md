# Qubic Ecosystem Services CCF Proposal (May - June 2025)

**Amount:** 97 Billion QUBIC\
**Destination Wallet:** `ECOSYSIWDJKGCGFUKJDKAELJXGVCBHKOWNULFIRGLEGPBDHRIFWDJFUCTRZE`\
**Rate Used:** 1 billion QUBIC = 1400 USDT

## 1. Rationale for Stand-Alone Request

During the last 8 months, the Ecosystem team has faced several internal and external challenges that have put at risk several commitments to the community. We aim to offer greater transparency in all our activities and potential dependencies to grow at a sustainable pace, ensuring Qubic's future mass adoption and success.

To achieve this, the Ecosystem team has decided to update the way we submit proposals:

- **QES (Qubic Ecosystem Services)** will submit, on a regular basis, stand-alone proposals for funding base costs such as salaries, infrastructure, audits, outsourcing services, and travel expenses. All of these proposals will contain a cost breakdown, timeline, and Deliverables/KPIs. These proposals aim to cover the regular costs associated with tasks performed by the Ecosystem team. This proposal serves as the first of its kind.
- **QES will submit ad-hoc proposals** for specific events, tools, or major changes that deserve Computors’ voting upon community decision (see section 3 - Deliverables for more detail about the process). All of these proposals will include a rationale, cost breakdown, Deliverables, KPIs, and ROI (when applicable).
- **QES considers this the best approach to financial transparency.** However, to maintain accountability for all duties assigned to QES, and acknowledging QES responsibilities with the community, all other submitted proposals, now or in the future, that may modify the Grants & Incubation governance model or any initiatives that QES represents, will be subject to QES approval. Otherwise, QES will not be responsible for any underperformance that may derive from such situations.
- **QES aims to be as transparent and efficient as possible** but also needs flexibility and independence to execute all commitments. It is not possible to pivot every 2 months if we want to make great things happen. Big things take time to execute.

*New deliverables will be joined to the roadmap that QCT and other Qubic teams have. Any existing deliverables assigned to the ecosystem team will be rolled into QES.*

**Dependencies:** Launch dates assume incubation teams complete their own code and QA on schedule; QES unblocks but cannot write all code for them.

## 7. Facts & Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1. Are you leaving QCS?**\
QES will operate financially independent (own budget, own reporting) but will still work on a shared roadmap with QCS and QCT. Anything already assigned to “Ecosystem” automatically rolls into QES; future cross-team tasks are coordinated.

**Q2. Long-term vision for QES?**

- Enable any dev team to go from idea to audited main-net launch with minimal friction.
- Replace today’s “hand-holding” with robust docs, boilerplates, and self-serve tooling—so teams become fully autonomous.
- Grow the builder funnel until most net-new Qubic dApps originate outside core teams.
- Provide ecosystem growth and business leadership and execution.
- QES aims to evolve from a project incubation operating model (now), where we support all early-stage initiatives to set up and validate viability/desirability/feasibility, to a scale-up VC operating model, where we will act as funding partners for projects with already validated product-market fit. Hence, QES will mature over time, assuming more long-term strategic tasks rather than the operational ones we are currently addressing.
- Elimination of territorial representatives. We will rely on ambassadors to cover the widest possible geographic area and provide them with the necessary training to represent Qubic.

**Q3. Why is smart-contract support such a big focus?**\
Smart contract development is the #1 blocker we see (compile quirks, CLI confusion, audit gaps). The supplier budget allows us to hire niche C++/Rust reviewers and pay for security audits on demand.

**Q4. Exchange listings—whose job?**\
Listings are not QES’ priority. We share introductions, due-diligence notes, and collaborate with QCS (who already track token-side business development).\
This is a joint QES-QCS workstream. QES’s responsibility is to establish first contact, originate potential deals, and support with due diligence for listings, while QCS continues negotiations until closing the deal.\
If a specific listing needs ecosystem firepower, we’ll raise a separate micro-proposal so the community can decide.

**Q5. How will you keep us in the loop?**

- Weekly status posts in `#QES` showing: roadmap board, next-week focus, blockers.
- Bi-weekly deep-dive (same data + milestone QA results).
- Open Q&A thread under every report (24–48 hour response).
- Private Discord workspace for incubations/grants to share code and get QA help—read-only “observer” role available for computors who want to watch.

**Q6. What if we need a new hackathon or a new initiative?**\
To provide full transparency and the opportunity for the community and Computors to decide where to spend funds, QES will regularly identify new initiatives, such as hackathons and open challenges, and draft a focused proposal (scope, costs, KPIs) for voting. This way, all initiatives can be measured independently.\
The base 97 billion QUBIC request only covers run-the-business ecosystem work.

**Q7. Expenses of servers**

- 1 testnet server for the public testnet, which we will operate with help from QCT.
- 3 testnet servers for team and solutions that are deployed.
