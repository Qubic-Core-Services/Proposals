## Details

This proposal seeks to list Qubic on a **Top-10 exchange**.  

**Funding Request:**  
- **Total Cost:** $330,000 USD  
- **Target Amount:** ~110 billion QUBIC @ $3000 per billion  
- **QU Donation Address:** ECOSYSIWDJKGCGFUKJDKAELJXGVCBHKOWNULFIRGLEGPBDHRIFWDJFUCTRZE  

**Timeline:**  
- Important: The listing is **not yet guaranteed**. Once it is confirmed, we will push to be allowed to make the exchange name public so the community can decide whether to proceed or not.  
- If the community decides **not** to proceed, the funds will be returned to the CCF.  
- If the USD value of the funds is higher at the time of payment, the surplus will be returned to the CCF. If it is lower, alternative sources such as donations will be required.  
- For conversion to USDT, priority will be given to OTC sales with existing requests; otherwise, a TWAP sale will be used.  
- This exchange is not currently accessible to US residents.  
- The exchange is considered Tier 1 by some in the market, and Tier 2 by others.  

**We need your feedback and approval!**  
- Share your thoughts on Discord.  
- Vote YES (Option 1) to greenlight this proposal.  
- Vote NO (Option 0) if you believe this is not the time and we should continue growing first.  

**Note:** It is impossible to predict the exact effect this listing may have, no matter how many simulations we run. The primary objective is to attract new investors and increase liquidity, which is likely to happen, but cannot be guaranteed.
