This document is updated regularly.

## General Questions  

**Why do some communities receive more funding than other communities?**  
Some communities receive more funding because they are of bigger strategic importance, have a track record of proven success, the experience of the Community Lead, or simply the cost of labour in the particular country. The cost of labour in, for example, Nigeria is much lower than in South Korea or France.  

**What is the funding period?**  
3 months  

**When does the proposal go live?**  
We will open a channel for discussion ideally today. We upload to the node on Thursday/Friday.  

**What is an ambassador program, in one sentence?**  
A structured network of community volunteers who earn rewards for promoting, educating, and supporting the project.  

**Why not just rely on paid marketing?**  
Ambassadors deliver authentic, peer-to-peer advocacy that paid ads cannot replicate, boosting credibility and organic reach.  

**How does it grow the community?**  
Ambassadors support the ecosystem team with business introductions, localize content, host meet-ups, and answer questions in real time, onboarding new users faster than the core team ever could.  

**Isn’t it expensive?**  
It’s surprisingly cost-efficient: modest token or stipend rewards scale far further than agency retainers while creating long-term holders. The different phases of community maturity offer Qubic multiple partnerships and proof of return on investment.  

**What specific value do ambassadors add?**  
- Business introductions to companies, academia and institutions.  
- Content creation (blogs, videos, memes, tutorials).  
- Localization of docs and social channels.  
- Community support and moderation in Discord/Telegram.  
- Event organization (AMAs, hackathons, meet-ups).  
- Rapid feedback loop, surfacing bugs and UX pain points.  

**How will you manage, for example, incorrect X posts?**  
If posts include incorrect numbers, Community Leads actively reach out to the ambassador and will ask them to update their post while also educating them where to find the correct information.  

**What if I don’t like the style of an ambassador X post?**  
Ambassadors have creative freedom in what style they want to post. Some write long analyses while others write more sales messages. We think a balance is important and will step in if an ambassador is “shilling” too much or if untruths are written.  

**How does it help decentralization?**  
Knowledge shifts from a single core team to hundreds of trusted community members distributed across time zones.  

**What about developer adoption?**  
Dev-centric ambassadors can run workshops and hopefully soon local hackathons.  

**Can it improve retention?**  
Yes. Active contributors feel ownership, turning from casual users into long-term evangelists who stay engaged through market cycles.  

**What risks should we watch?**  
Over-incentivizing “shilling,” unclear guidelines, and brand dilution. Mitigate with tiered rewards, clear KPIs, and regular monthly reviews.  

**What is the Code of Conduct?**  
All Ambassadors agree with the Qubican Code of Conduct before they join the program. Failing to comply will result in a warning or expulsion from the Ambassador Program.

# FAQ – Content Creator Program  

**What is the current status of the Ambassador and Content Creator program?**  
The program is live in production with a proven operating mechanism including evolution, hierarchy, partnerships, community building, and events. The main bottleneck is the budget ceiling, which limits both recruitment and reward depth.  

**Why is an “extension” needed now?**  
We have proven traction with visible results, growing demand, community synergy through equipped leaders, perfect timing for more educational content, existing infrastructure that reduces costs, and the ability to generate more actionable KPIs.  

**What is the main purpose of this budget request?**  
To increase the monthly budget to recruit more content creators, better reward performance, equip and supervise via community leaders, and improve amplification and tooling.  

**What's the recruitment process for new creators?**  
Each community proposes creators plus a recruitment wave. Evaluation uses a 1-5 rubric covering Impact/Reach, Outreach ability, Quality/Feel, and Reliability. Top creators per community are selected based on quotas by size/activity, validated by Community Leaders and Program Manager.  

**How is the budget structured?**  
The Season 4 envelope is split into four sub-pools:  
- Performance bounties (global + per community leaderboard)  
- Excellence bonuses (deep-dives, protocol comparisons, high-audience Spaces)  
- Community acceleration fund (micro-budgets for translations, co-creations, assets)  
- Monthly contests  

**What are the evaluation criteria for creators?**  
- Impact/Reach: Impressions, engagement rate, click-through rate, views  
- Outreach: Ability to reach other ecosystems beyond the "Qubic bubble"  
- Quality/Feel: Clarity, accuracy, tone, originality  
- Reliability: Regularity, meeting deadlines, compliance  

**Who gets rewarded in this system?**  
The majority goes to creators for performance remuneration and tooling/amplification support (templates, creative support, reporting).  

**Are there bonuses for collaboration?**  
Yes, there are inter-community synergy bonuses, for example when communities collaborate on Spaces or other joint content.  

**What makes this different from just hiring more ambassadors?**  
This addresses frustration from creators who want to be ambassadors but were previously ineligible for rewards. It creates a separate track for content creators while maintaining the ambassador structure.  

**How do Community Leaders support creators?**  
They provide coaching on angles, structure, and timing; rapid validation of sensitive content; verification of outreach proofs; and signaling of outreach opportunities.  

**What types of content get excellence bonuses?**  
Deep-dive analyses, protocol comparisons with other projects, and high-audience Twitter Spaces or similar events.  

**How does the community acceleration fund work?**  
It provides micro-budgets managed by community leaders for specific needs like translations, co-creations, follow-ups, and asset creation within their communities.  

**What's the advantage of having existing infrastructure?**  
We already have community leaders in place and new communities being recruited, which reduces costs and strengthens training for existing creators while giving them access to community resources.  

**How will success be measured?**  
Through improved KPIs including awareness metrics, qualified traffic, and conversions. The program will track performance across communities and individual creators.  

**What prevents gaming or abuse of the system?**  
Talentnodes and the Program Managers retain final arbitration on anti-gaming measures, with Community Leaders providing local oversight and proof verification.  

**What's the timeline for this extension?**  
The proposal targets a recruitment wave just before Season 4 (S04) to identify and onboard the best content creators in each community.  

**How does this scale with community growth?**  
As communities mature, their funding needs increase to support better production, amplification, and coordination. The budget architecture scales with community size and activity levels.
