## What does Strategy & Operations do?

The S&O team is responsible for translating Qubic’s strategic vision into tangible results by overseeing the day-to-day execution of the company’s roadmap and milestones. We ensure that teams, resources, and timelines are coordinated to meet key milestones and that visibility is created towards the community and investors; whether it’s launching a new hackathon, an upcoming IPO, ecosystem achievements or achieving financial targets.

We focus on 6 different areas:

* Bridging Strategic Vision with Day-to-Day Execution. Qubic has a bold vision and ambitious roadmap, but the path to achieve them can be unclear or inconsistent. S\&O breaks down high-level objectives into actionable plans, ensuring that the entire organization understands how to move from ideas to tangible results.
* Support Special Projects and Strategic Initiatives. Some projects or strategic initiatives require additional strategic support. S\&O helps drive and support special projects and initiatives that are crucial for further development of the ecosystem like the Qubican ambassador program.
* Eliminating Operational Inefficiencies. Silos, redundant processes, and communication breakdowns can slow a company’s progress and waste reS\&Ources. By designing streamlined workflows, setting up cross-functional meetings, and standardizing reporting tools, S\&O ensures smooth coordination between different workgroups, reducing bottlenecks and cutting costs.
* Managing ReS\&Ource Allocation. Rapid growth or shifting priorities can lead to misallocated budgets, overlooked initiatives, or unbalanced team capacities.S\&O supports workgroups with headcount planning, tool usage and operational sustainability.
* Mitigating Risks and Addressing Crises Proactively. Qubic faces a variety of internal and external legal risks, regulatory changes and other disruptions that can derail progress if unaddressed. S\&O develops risk management frameworks, gives legal counsel and creates contingency plans. They keep a pulse on potential issues, allocating reS\&Ources and coordinating teams to reS\&Olve problems before they escalate into major setbacks.
* Measuring Performance and Driving Accountability. Without transparent metrics and accountability structures, teams may lose focus or underperform against key objectives.S\&O implements frameworks (like OKRs) and dashboards that track progress against milestones. By holding regular reviews and communicating results, we ensure that every workgroup remains aligned and responsible for delivering on commitments.

## S\&O Q2 Review - Wins & Learnings

* Launch and coordination of the season 3 Ambassador Program. The program currently consists of 9 communities (France, Spain, Nomads, USA, Russia, China, Nigeria, Turkey, Germany) and includes close to a 100 members. We are currently in the process of onboarding Vietnam, South Korea and LATM as new ambassador communities. The program is an extension of Qubic Marketing and Ecosystem team, providing consistent online social presence, event support and business partnership introductions like RaiseHack, Madrid Hackathon, Istanbul Blockchain Week and more.

* Manage the legal entity in the Seychelles allowing Qubic to review contracts and close agreements. Currently transitioning private agreements to agreements made through the legal structure. 70% of all Qubic team members in the core workgroups have signed confidentiality agreements

* Successfully supported the ecosystem team with managing a legal framework that will allow it to engage with market makers and exchanges. In Q3 S\&OF will continue to offer legal, risk management and problem solving support across workgroups.

* Increased visibility of the Qubic ecosystem by organizing the Qubic ecosystem all-hands, proposal AMA and X Spaces. At peak we had 130 Discord members join each all-hands , with 80 members as a low. The S\&O team organized various X Spaces and in prompt DC stages to talk about the Discord. In Q3, we continue to aim to expand Qubic visibility by organizing public monthly/quarterly business reviews and organizing community X spaces with ambassadors and public media.

* The S\&O team is a Swiss army knife. We supported various workgroups to execute on the roadmap; events, hiring, marketing, strategy meetings, CCF proposals, media appearances and legal counsel. In Q3, we continue with providing the same support.

Manage roadmap progression. The team has made a significant impact with various high impact initiatives such as monero mining,

## Learnings

* The process of transferring private to corporate agreements is taking too long. Major blocker has been the director of the company which has been solved.
* Data collecting and metrics tracking is still a manual process. With the arrival of Qwatch this should improve.
* The management of the season 2 ambassador program was a considerable workload. The ambassador program team has hired two part-time program managers that take some of that workload.
* The increased level of decentralization is causing more confusion across some of the workgroup. It's more challenging to know who owns certain information and who's the driver behind it. It's becoming more challenging to hold teams/individuals accountable. 

## Strategy & Operations Strategy

The S\&O team focusses on different areas: bridging strategic vision with day-to-day execution, supporting special projects and strategic initiatives, eliminating operational inefficiencies, managing resource allocation, mitigating risks and addressing crises proactively.

## Note:

The budget covers August to October. The previous budget eventually covered April, May, June and July as the Qubic price increased.
The majority of funds will be spent on salaries, legal and operational fees. As we aim to support more work groups, we open 1 or 2x 0.5 headcount in August. A proportion of the funding will be allocated to the operating costs of the legal entity, compliance matters regarding new partnerships and exchange contracts.
Current team members work as independent contractors and agencies
Salaries are paid in QUBIC depending on individual agreement

### Governance

Any unspent funds (e.g., due to an increase in QUBIC’s market value) will either be used to cover expenses for the months or returned to the CCF in the event of QCS disS\&Olution.
To ensure transparency and proper management of CCF funds, QCS provides access to relevant documentation such as transaction history, salary detail,expenditure and objective progression on [https://q-c-s.com/](https://q-c-s.com/).
