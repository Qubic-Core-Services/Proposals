# Qubic Exchange Listing Proposal for Top-15 Global Exchange

**Request to CCF to approve 27.58 billion QUBIC for listing on a Top-15 global exchange**

## Proposal

**Available Options:**  
- **Option 0:** No, I don’t approve  
- **Option 1:** Yes, approve 27.58 billion QUBIC for listing  

## Details

This proposal seeks to list Qubic on a **Top-15 global exchange**, officially licensed in South Korea, a key market where Qubic has no presence yet. This leading platform provides unmatched access to a rapidly growing user base in Asia and beyond, offering a unique strategic opportunity. Currently, it is the only exchange providing such a listing possibility. However, U.S. citizens cannot pass KYC due to regulatory restrictions. Expanding the Qubic community to South Korea would be very positive to attract trading volume in this market.

With daily liquidity across Qubic’s ecosystem exceeding $5M USD, this listing will strengthen our infrastructure and position Qubic for Tier 1 listings in 2025.

**Funding Request:**  
- **Total Cost:** $40,000 USD  
  - $20,000 USDT  
  - $20,000 USD worth in QUBIC  
- **Target Amount:** ~27.58 billion QUBIC @ $1450 per billion  
- **QU Donation Address:** ECOSYSIWDJKGCGFUKJDKAELJXGVCBHKOWNULFIRGLEGPBDHRIFWDJFUCTRZE  

**Timeline:**  
- Integration to be completed within 4 weeks post-payment.  
- Target listing: July 2025  

**Note:** Due to a confidentiality agreement, the exchange’s name cannot be disclosed, as doing so would void the agreement.

**We need your feedback and approval!**  
- Share your thoughts on Discord.  
- Vote YES (Option 1) to greenlight this proposal
- Vote NO (Option 0) if you believe we should explore other opportunities

Thank you for your support in driving Qubic’s global growth, and thanks to the community for shaping this proposal
