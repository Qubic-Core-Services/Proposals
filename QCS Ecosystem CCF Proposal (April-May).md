- **From April onward:** All expenses can be tracked on [https://q-c-s.com/](https://q-c-s.com/)

The [previous funding proposal](https://github.com/Zgirt/QCS-Budget-Q12025/blob/a3446e0/README.md) was approved in epoch 145. QCS received **276 bln QUBIC** from the CCF. This amount, initially estimated to cover QCS running costs for February to April, was not enough to cover the month of April due to fluctuating market prices. Since some team members and partners receive payment in QUBIC, some workgroups (Marketing & Operations) had to delay payments to the next funding round.

## QCS 2025 Milestone Tracker: Progress Through the Year

QCS success indicators are determined by the published [roadmap](https://qubic.org/roadmap) and Qubic milestones. Each individual workgroup discusses its successes and learnings in the section below the milestone summary.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42d6bf12-5321-4090-98ad-fb4a220c567d)

### Summary Highlights

- Daily Active Users (DAU) increased significantly, from an average of 3.5K to 6K. This is especially impressive considering we did not yet have user-facing interfaces for key applications like QX throughout the entire quarter.  
- The ratio of active wallets to holder wallets has shown stronger growth on the holder side. As more dApps are launched, we expect the number of active wallets to increase throughout Q2.  
- We anticipated reaching $10M in average daily trading volume. At peak, we achieved over $50M in a single day. However, due to the declining price action, we averaged $6M daily, falling short of our target.  
- Qubic also set a goal of achieving $30M in average TVL. We ultimately averaged $22.2M, largely due to price performance and the early-stage maturity of the ecosystem.  
- Qubic delivered three IPOs and dApps in Q1: QVault, Qubicbay, and MSVault. With four IPOs planned for Q2, we are confident in exceeding our quarterly goals. Additionally, we aim to launch Nevtrace, a powerful integration that allows Qubic to connect with any application via a visual “Make” interface — enabling complex workflows without writing a single line of code. Beyond that, two more applications are in preparation for potential IPOs: a B2AI application leveraging Qubic’s new MPC protocol for AI and a decentralized funding platform focused on NGO-driven projects.  
- In terms of ecosystem growth, Qubic overachieved on partnership goals in Q1. Strategic partnerships were signed with Alastria and the Comunidad de Madrid, helping Qubic sponsor MadHack and attract top talent. We partnered with Qatum to onboard large-scale mining facilities. Onyze joined as a custodian partner to facilitate institutional onboarding. We also finalized a strategic partnership with Certik for auditing and security. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect to sign at least five more major agreements, including: a top blockchain-based data and research company, more DEX aggregators, AI research institutions and additional Layer 1 and Layer 2 protocol integrations.  


If we were able to exceed some of our most ambitious goals during a quarter of price decline, we are extremely confident that with the foundation now in place, Q2 will bring significantly higher DAU on-chain and improved performance across all key metrics.

## Key Takeaway

**"We built the base. Now we scale."**  


QCS overdelivered on several key initiatives during a challenging quarter — the hardest part is behind us. With a strong pipeline and increasing ecosystem maturity, Q2 is poised to deliver exponential growth across users, usage, and integrations.

## Ecosystem Q1 Summary

During Q1, the most important milestones have been remarkable:  
1) The organization of MAD HACK 2025, which became the most significant hackathon of the year, achieving what once seemed impossible: over 25 teams building on Qubic, with half of them delivering a working MVP.  
2) In collaboration with core-tech, we established the procedure to deploy private testnets and created a smart contract for functional testing. We saw a team during the hackathon ship a full Dapp and smart contract on a weekend. It is not production ready but now teams can build independently and faster. We provided the servers for the hackathon teams and public testnet  
3) The incorporation of four new teams into the Qubic ecosystem.  
4) Strategic collaborations and partnerships with institutions such as Comunidad de Madrid, Alastria, and Telefónica.  
5) The implementation of a Project Management Office (PMO) to scale grant and incubation programs, as well as internal development initiatives.  
6) The development of an online IDE for smart contracts, which now serves as the foundation for a future Remix-like environment for Qubic once we evolve and deploy the software again.

Despite these successes, due to Qubic’s price situation, we’ve had to reduce costs, resulting in the loss of two valuable team members.  
Key lessons from Q1 have shown that the greatest value lies in attracting developers and entrepreneurs, as well as building high-quality libraries that make interfaces like QX much easier to develop. Additionally, institutional and academic partnerships—especially through our scientists—bring visibility and credibility to the ecosystem.

## Ecosystem Strategy

The Ecosystem Team is executing a growth and developer attraction strategy, which consists of the following key points:

- Continuing the grants and incubation programs.  
- Bringing in a Lead Developer and a Full Stack Developer to further the development of tools for developers, as well as applications that enhance the ecosystem.  
- Attending AI-focused events led by our scientists, updating our research with a new paper, and continuing submissions to call-for-papers. This also includes a new plan to attract academia to Qubic.  
- Supporting and coordinating with the marketing team for participation in strategic events.

## Incubation & Grants Progress

In the last quarter of last year, we attracted the first incubation projects, such as Vottun, Nostromo, Uniswap in Qubic, and began developing libraries as well as conducting security audits. Additionally, grants were approved, enabling the development of new tools and utilities for developers, including projects from the last batch like Onyze, QEarn, Qatum, Qxboard, QDashboard, and multiple supporting libraries

### Grants Overview
- 5 Total Grants projects  
- 7 Projects 100% delivered  
- 5 Projects approx. 70% developed  
- 1 Project Blocked  
- 2 Projects on hold  

**Execution & Funding:**  
- ✅ 75% Total execution  
- ✅ $114.7K funded  
- ✅ $34.2K pending  

### Incubation Overview
- 5 Total Incubation projects + 1 audit already delivered  
- 1 Project approx. 90% developed  
- 4 Projects approx. 50% developed  

**Execution & Funding:**  
- ✅ 65% Total execution  
- ✅ $128K funded  
- ✅ $150K pending  

The grants and incubation programs already have their own funding, and this budget allocation will not expand these funds. Current expenses can be viewed in the following spreadsheets:  
• [Grants](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zvda8WZzVljbu6LKMxdTnNlt2Fj5T65xlH6FSOvO33k/edit?usp=sharing)  
• [Incubation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ncuM_LT8HFMuD5D7FXHGrXITACNgD2W17FZqxygz58A/edit?usp=sharing)  

Currently, they have a treasury, after deducting the payments for pending milestones once completed, of 13.3B and 114.6B for grants and incubation, respectively. This treasury is only used to pay for grants and incubation projects.  Due to the drop in QUBIC’s price, the costs for grants and incubation have increased significantly.

During Q1, we did not onboard new incubation teams, as we focused on improving project onboarding processes. We identified bottlenecks and are actively working on solutions, including internally developing online IDEs, streamlining smart contract deployment processes in collaboration with Core-Tech and developing smart contracts for incubation projects

---

## Event Strategy & Global Presence

- Presence in key events in the US  
- In April, our scientists will attend ICLR in Singapore, providing exposure for Aigarth’s advancements at the most important AI conference  
- Collaboration with ambassadors to organize events in key locations.

---

## Operational Improvements & Team Growth

- We have developed q-c-s.com, allowing tracking of all payments, eliminating the need for spreadsheets  
- We have developed online IDEs for smart contracts and CLI. We have prepared more than 20 nodes to act as testnet nodes so teams can do functional testing of their smart contracts. We are also working on having a functional testnet along with QCT.  
- A Project Manager has been onboarded, laying the foundation for a PMO to scale as the number of projects grows  
- Hiring a representative for Asia is still pending. The missing US representative position can be covered by Jennifer King  
- Bringing in a Lead Developer and a Full Stack Developer to further the development of tools for developers, as well as applications that enhance the ecosystem.

---

## Q2 Budget Allocation Priorities

- Continuing the event strategy and increasing global presence  
- Further development of libraries and utilities to attract more entrepreneurs to Qubic  
- Ecosystem expenses are allocated for team salaries, market makers, events, scientific team, and associated costs for the mentioned operations. It is not included in the budget costs to list in T1 exchanges.  
- Also we are already in advanced negotiations with a new market maker that we want to onboard as soon as possible now that we have the legal entity ready.

## Budget Breakdown

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f914094d-565d-438a-923d-5a34d22c933c)

The budget would cover **April and May**

**Note:**
- Current team members work as independent contractors.  
- Salaries are paid in QUBIC depending on individual agreement.  
- We can cover most of the April salaries with the remaining funds we have in Ecosystem.

**Governance**  
- Any unspent funds (e.g., due to an increase in QUBIC’s market value) will either be used to cover expenses for the months or returned to the CCF in the event of QCS dissolution.  
- To ensure transparency and proper management of CCF funds, QCS provides access to relevant documentation such as transaction history, salary detail, expenditure and objective progression on [https://q-c-s.com/](https://q-c-s.com/).
