The Qubic Ambassador Program is a global initiative aimed at building local communities that are passionate about Qubic. They are our boots on the ground. Qubican’s (ambassadors) will lead on expanding Qubic’s global reach by organising local events, educating local communities, and contributing to the growth of the Qubic ecosystem by integrating more closely with the ecosystem, marketing and operation teams.  
To further professionalize and scale the ambassador program into targeted ecosystem areas, we’re proposing a CCF request to fund the Season 3 of the Qubican program with X Qubic. This season Community Leads and ambassadors will have more responsibilities as they will be trained to become an extension of the ecosystem and marketing team.

The season covers a period of 2 months.

## Who are Qubicans and what are their Season 3 Objectives
Qubic Ambassadors (Qubicans) are passionate individuals from around the globe that help grow the Qubic ecosystem. There are two distinct types of ambassador roles, each contributing to the ecosystem in a unique way:  
**Qubican Community Leaders** – Lead the local community, manage the local treasury, local strategy and Discord. They also take the lead to organise local meetups, conferences, workshops, and (virtual) events to engage and expand Qubic's presence in your area.  
**Qubican Ambassadors** – are members of local Qubican communities and are organized in workgroups that complete specialized tasks like content creation, community management, partnership/investor introductions and more. Ambassador can have both technical and non-technical backgrounds.  
**Qubican Contributors** - are members of local Qubic communities but who still need to earn their stripes.  

Program Managers: Raziah, Kimz  
Community Leads: Seb, Raziah (France), Kimz (Nomad), SpaceCaddet, RetroDrive (USA), Drac, Jort (Spain), Emmanuel, Xxodux (Nigeria), Yigit, Alaracam (Turkey)  
To-be onboarded Leads: Martis (Germany), Xingyuan (China, Chinuk, Kavatak (Russia))  
Community Leads together form a “quorum” that collectively votes on key-decisions and the direction of the ambassador program.  

The ambassador program will focus on achieving **5 objectives** in Season 3:  
1. **Community Expansion & Maturity:** strengthen current communities (Germany, Russia, China) and launch new ones in strategic important locations (Korea).  
2. **Functional Integration with Core Teams:** train selected ambassadors to support ecosystem and marketing teams locally with different tasks.  
3. **Content & Visibility Goal:** Increase global reach with decentralized content pipelines  
4. **Local Events & Hackathons:** Empower regions to run self-managed IRL impact initiatives  
5. **Incentives, Funding & Autonomy:** Retain top performers and reward entrepreneurial energy

## Season 2 Review

### Impact achievements
- We grew the program from 20 to roughly 70 ambassadors.  
- We onboarded 12 community leads that actively lead and coordinate local Qubic communities.  
- After the first event in Slovenia. We organized 5 events across Spain, Turkey and Nigeria but also supported Qubic core teams at the Madrid Hackathon.  
- We represented Qubic at Paris Blockchain Week, Crypto XR and Token 2049.  
- Delivered a top 3 winner of the Madrid Hackathon (Qulang) and recruited several attendees to join the hackathon.  
- We further increased the number of impressions and engagement on X. For example Qubic France product 50 videos by recognized influencers, reaching around 3m views (YouTube/X)  
- Creation of three new communities: Germany, Russia and China  
- Two fast growing X podcasts (Qubic & Chill and La Qubineta)  

### Challenges & learnings
- Community stands and falls with engagement. Not every new joiner is automatically an ambassador. Only members that actively contribute, earn the rank of ambassador should become an ambassador.  
- Target markets where Qubic lacks a footprint needs more localized marketing to get started (NA, SEA)  
- Onboarding of new ambassadors takes time. They need to feel like they can make an impact (and make some qus)  
- Ambassadors are rewarded on impact with qus. Without sufficient funding it’s extremely challenging to keep top ambassadors or to organize events.

## How will we spend the funds?

### Community Expansion & Maturity
Launch and support 4 new regional chapters (Germany, China, Russia,), including onboarding and activation by recruiting local leads, provide chapter starter kits, and activate communities via Zealy quests and Telegram missions.

### Functional Integration with Core Teams
Train ambassadors to support the ecosystem and marketing teams with business development, partnership introductions, academic introductions, creatives and social media posting, by creating learning paths, run onboarding workshops, and selecting top ambassadors.  
Specifically the ecosystem team will develop a “train the trainer” program where they will deliver learning services to the community leaders in two main areas:  
- Business development and pitching  
- Qubic technical knowledge  

As Qubic doesn't have Qubic Ecosystem Representatives anymore, the ecosystem team will also train Community Leads how to represent Qubic institutionally.  

### Content & Visibility Goal
Enable community-driven content creation such as social media posts, podcasts, videos and blogs by providing branded templates, a creative asset library, publishing guidelines, and content bounties through Zealy or direct support.

### Local Events & Hackathons
Support self-managed hackathons, educational workshops, and university outreach led by ambassadors by sharing event templates, provide micro-funding, connect leads to core team for support, and enable peer learning.

### Incentives, Funding & Autonomy
In Season 3, we are evolving our funding model. Where previous seasons focused heavily on incentivizing task completion via Zealy, we are now reallocating a larger portion of the budget directly to the best performing local communities. Best performing communities are communities that have proven over time to make an impact on Qubic, like Qubic France, Spain and Nomads. This shift is designed to give chapter leads and top ambassadors more freedom, ownership, and responsibility to grow their ecosystems in the ways that matter most locally.  

Whether it’s organizing meetups, distributing micro-grants, producing localized content, building university relationships, launching social campaigns, or initiating grassroots partnerships, this model encourages more entrepreneurship and accountability as a local community. Another key step toward long-term sustainability and further decentralization.  

**Reporting**  
Community Leads provide a monthly report to the community with the progress made across the program. Funding for the next month is only released if enough progression has been achieved.

The expenses can be tracked here through publicly available wallets broken down by local communities too. Community Leads will own their finances but Kimz, Raziah, Drac, Jort and Talentnodes form a finance committee that oversees spending.  

The overall increase in comparison with season 2 is $9k (total $46k in S022). In comparison, we‘re onboarding 3 new communities and are looking to add a 4th community with South Korea. All these locations are strategically important locations for Qubic if we are to grow the network.  

Funds are allocated to communities on a monthly basis. We only provide funding after the agreed progression has been achieved. We will provide monthly reporting to the community in the #ambassador channel.  

Any funds that are left will be either carried over to the next ambassador program season or transferred back directly to the CCF.

## Benchmark with other ambassador programs
Ambassador Programs are popular in crypto and are funded differently depending on the size of the project and number of ambassadors. Ecosystems pushing for rapid global expansion now earmark $200 k-$500 k in stablecoins or liquid tokens. In 2025, Solana Superteam funded 500k a year. LunarStorm announced a 1M rewards sprint. Smaller projects about 100k a year depending on their maturity stage. The most important take away is that budgets scale with the community size and GTM goals.

## Governance
The Qubican program is run by some of Qubics biggest contributors. Together they form the Qubican Quorum. Program decisions are made by Quorum. Local Community decisions are made by the Community Leads together with their workgroups. Anyone can apply to start a local community as long as the requirements are met. Below an overview of the current governance structure.  
Ambassadors can earn compensation by completing Zealy tasks or by helping their local communities. Both Program Program Managers and Community Leads are paid a monthly compensation, depending on the impact they had. Their impact is measured through the KPI’s mentioned above. Talentnodes, Jennifer and Alber are not
