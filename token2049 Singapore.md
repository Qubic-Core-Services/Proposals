## Why TOKEN2049  

TOKEN2049 Singapore stands as the world’s largest crypto event, consistently drawing 25,000+ attendees from 160+ countries, featuring over 300 speakers and 500+ exhibitors, with >60% of participants at the C-level.  
It forms the flagship centerpiece of TOKEN2049 Week, a broader festival spanning a full week with hundreds of side-events TOKEN2049 Side events; from meetups and hackathons to VIP dinners and product launches.  

## Why This Matters for Qubic:  
We are achieving unprecedented technological milestones and we have a unique AI-driven roadmap but visibility, which we lack, is what TOKEN2049 gives us as a unique chance to:  

- **Claim Mindshare**: If Qubic isn’t there, someone else will own the conversation. Being present means we shape the narrative. The Qubic side event will allow us to pick and choose the guests that we want to speak with. In addition the Qubic team will organize a 30min workshop where we talk about Qubic, the mining POC and Aigarth.  
- **Showcase Innovation**: our mining POC (51% XMR hashrate), scalable smart contracts, 15.5M TPS and AGI make Qubic stand out, and TOKEN2049 is where differentiation is valued.  
- **Build Strategic Bridges**: Strong focus on developing partnerships, dev collaborations and more. With Qubic being on the news, this is the perfect time to speak to partners that would be out of reach a few months ago.  
- **Ignite Community Growth**: Thousands of builders and investors are looking for the “next big thing.” Qubic is that Big Thing; Time for them to recognize it.  
- **Asian Market Extension (+T1)**: TOKEN2049 is the gateway into Asia’s crypto market which will help to pave the way for Qubic to extend in many markets with alignment with T1 listing.  
- **Talent Acquisition**: TOKEN2049 is attended by thousands of builders, developers, and grassroots community leaders. These are the people who can extend Qubic’s reach organically, via for example the Qubican Ambassador Program.  


## What Success Looks Like:  

- **Brand awareness and partnerships**: Secure at least 20 meaningful conversations converting at at least 3 ongoing collaborations.  
- **Workshop**: fully attended Qubic workshop, with at least 20 attendees registered.  
- **Side event**: We reserved a location for a Qubic side event which allows us to invite 100+ guests exclusively for Qubic. We need at least 75% confirmed guests.  
- **Community growth**: Recruit a Singaporean Community Lead for the Ambassador Program.  
- **Media presence**: Secure at least 1 interview with a crypto media outlet.  
- **Developer onboarding**: Opportunity to connect with developers participating in the TOKEN2049 Hackathon. We aim to onboard at least 2 development teams for incubation submission.
