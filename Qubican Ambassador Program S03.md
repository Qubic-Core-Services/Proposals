## About the Qubic Ambassador Program
The **Qubic Ambassador Program** (“Qubicans”) builds passionate local communities worldwide.  
Ambassadors organize events, educate users, and serve as an on-the-ground extension of the ecosystem, marketing, and operations teams.

Season 3 professionalises and scales this effort by giving Community Leads (CLs) and ambassadors more responsibility through targeted training and budget autonomy.

## Season 3 Objectives
1. **Community Expansion & Maturity** – strengthen Germany, Russia, China; launch Korea.  
2. **Functional Integration** – train ambassadors to support core ecosystem & marketing tasks.  
3. **Content & Visibility** – create decentralised content pipelines (podcasts, videos, memes, translations).

## Season 2 Review

### Impact Achievements
- Expanded from **20 → ~70** ambassadors; onboarded **12** CLs.  
- Ran **5** events across Spain, Turkey, Nigeria; supported Madrid Hackathon (Top-3 “Qulang”).  
- Represented Qubic at **Paris Blockchain Week, Crypto XR, Token 2049**.  
- Qubic France produced **50** influencer videos (~ 3 M views).  
- Launched new communities in **Germany, Russia, China**.  
- Two fast-growing X podcasts: **“Qubic & Chill”, “La Qubineta”**.

### Challenges & Learnings
- Engagement is critical; only active contributors become ambassadors.  
- New regions (NA, SEA) need more localised marketing.  
- Onboarding takes time; impact-based rewards require stable funding.
