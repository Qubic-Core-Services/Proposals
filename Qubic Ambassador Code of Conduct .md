# Qubic Ambassador Code of Conduct  

The Qubic Ambassador Program thrives on decentralization, innovation, and mutual respect. As Qubicans, we are guardians of the Qubic brand. Every action, online or offline, should reinforce the project’s reputation for transparency, integrity, and vision.  


## Core Principles  

- **Integrity & Brand Stewardship** – Act honestly, avoid conflicts of interest, and safeguard Qubic’s name and public image.  
- **Respect** – Treat all individuals with dignity; harassment, hate speech, or personal attacks to other ambassadors and Qubic community members are forbidden and are grounds for expulsion of the Ambassador Program.  
- **Constructive Participation** – Contribute positively, give helpful feedback, and nurture open dialogue.  
- **Inclusivity** – Welcome members of all backgrounds, identities, and experience levels.  
- **Accountability** – Own your words and deeds whenever representing Qubic.
