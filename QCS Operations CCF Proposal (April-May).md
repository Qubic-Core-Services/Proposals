**KOL Partnership With Miles Deutscher:**

- A QCS employee closed a private agreement with Miles Deutscher. This agreement was approved by quorum but also with the approval of QCS and QCT.  
- The results were disappointing over a period of time despite frequent feedback conversation. After 3 weeks from the start of the agreement, QCS decided to step in and support the QCS employee with terminating the agreement with the KOL.  
- As a result the remaining 90 QUBIC billion funds went to the Ecosystem team. 29.714 billion have been spent, most of it went to expenses related to MAD HACK as shown in the following image:

# Financial Reports Can Be Found Here:

- **From Jan – March:** [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NQfzfmqHJOxStRm6k6l9hrg21nFGdFj--ezKtmJ8AdU/edit?usp=sharing)  
- **From April onward:** All expenses can be tracked on [https://q-c-s.com/](https://q-c-s.com/)

The [previous funding proposal](https://github.com/Zgirt/QCS-Budget-Q12025/blob/a3446e0/README.md) was approved in epoch 145. QCS received **276 bln QUBIC** from the CCF. This amount, initially estimated to cover QCS running costs for February to April, was not enough to cover the month of April due to fluctuating market prices. Since some team members and partners receive payment in QUBIC, some workgroups (Marketing & Operations) had to delay payments to the next funding round.

## Team Structure

An updated list with the current QCS team can be found [here](https://github.com/Qubic-Core-Services/Proposals/blob/main/Qubic%20Core%20Services%20(QCS)%20Team.md).

## QCS Overview

Qubic Core Services (QCS) is requesting funds from the Computor Control Fund (CCF) to fund running costs like salaries and to fund activities for Marketing, Ecosystem Development, Community Management, Strategy, Finance, and Operations.

While the requested budgets are presented as separate proposals for clarity and administrative purposes, it is important to note that these components are interdependent and are designed to function cohesively. The effectiveness and intended outcomes of the budget request can only be achieved when these budgets are considered and executed collectively with other business units.

**The requested funding will be allocated to:**
- Settle outstanding payments for March 2025.
- Pay team salaries for Q2 2025 (April – May).
- Fund roadmap activities for Ecosystem Development, Marketing, Community Management, Strategy, Finance, and Operations.

## QCS 2025 Milestone Tracker: Progress Through the Year

QCS success indicators are determined by the published [roadmap](https://qubic.org/roadmap) and Qubic milestones. Each individual workgroup discusses its successes and learnings in the section below the milestone summary.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/894e448f-d6e7-4559-918d-6cb2387135e8)

### Summary Highlights

- Daily Active Users (DAU) increased significantly, from an average of 3.5K to 6K. This is especially impressive considering we did not yet have user-facing interfaces for key applications like QX throughout the entire quarter.  
- The ratio of active wallets to holder wallets has shown stronger growth on the holder side. As more dApps are launched, we expect the number of active wallets to increase throughout Q2.  
- We anticipated reaching $10M in average daily trading volume. At peak, we achieved over $50M in a single day. However, due to the declining price action, we averaged $6M daily, falling short of our target.  
- Qubic also set a goal of achieving $30M in average TVL. We ultimately averaged $22.2M, largely due to price performance and the early-stage maturity of the ecosystem.  
- Qubic delivered three IPOs and dApps in Q1: QVault, Qubicbay, and MSVault. With four IPOs planned for Q2, we are confident in exceeding our quarterly goals. Additionally, we aim to launch Nevtrace, a powerful integration that allows Qubic to connect with any application via a visual “Make” interface — enabling complex workflows without writing a single line of code. Beyond that, two more applications are in preparation for potential IPOs: a B2AI application leveraging Qubic’s new MPC protocol for AI and a decentralized funding platform focused on NGO-driven projects.  
- In terms of ecosystem growth, Qubic overachieved on partnership goals in Q1. Strategic partnerships were signed with Alastria and the Comunidad de Madrid, helping Qubic sponsor MadHack and attract top talent. We partnered with Qatum to onboard large-scale mining facilities. Onyze joined as a custodian partner to facilitate institutional onboarding. We also finalized a strategic partnership with Certik for auditing and security. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect to sign at least five more major agreements, including: a top blockchain-based data and research company, more DEX aggregators, AI research institutions and additional Layer 1 and Layer 2 protocol integrations.  


If we were able to exceed some of our most ambitious goals during a quarter of price decline, we are extremely confident that with the foundation now in place, Q2 will bring significantly higher DAU on-chain and improved performance across all key metrics.

## Key Takeaway

**"We built the base. Now we scale."**  


QCS overdelivered on several key initiatives during a challenging quarter — the hardest part is behind us. With a strong pipeline and increasing ecosystem maturity, Q2 is poised to deliver exponential growth across users, usage, and integrations.

## What is Strategy, Finance & Operations

The SFO team is responsible for translating Qubic’s strategic vision into tangible results by overseeing the day-to-day execution of the company’s roadmap and milestones. We ensure that teams, resources, and timelines are coordinated to meet key milestones and that visibility is created towards the community and investors; whether it’s launching a new hackathon, an upcoming IPO, ecosystem achievements or achieving financial targets.  

We focus on 6 different area’s:

**1. Bridging Strategic Vision with Day-to-Day Execution.** Qubic has a bold vision and ambitious roadmap, but the path to achieve them can be unclear or inconsistent. SFO breaks down high-level objectives into actionable plans, ensuring that the entire organization understands how to move from ideas to tangible results.

**2. Support Special Projects and Strategic Initiatives.** Some projects or strategic initiatives require additional strategic support. SFO helps drive and support special projects and initiatives that are crucial for further development of the ecosystem like the Qubican ambassador program.  

**3. Eliminating Operational Inefficiencies.** Silos, redundant processes, and communication breakdowns can slow a company’s progress and waste resources. By designing streamlined workflows, setting up cross-functional meetings, and standardizing reporting tools, SFO ensures smooth coordination between different workgroups, reducing bottlenecks and cutting costs.

**4. Managing Resource Allocation.** Rapid growth or shifting priorities can lead to misallocated budgets, overlooked initiatives, or unbalanced team capacities.SFO supports workgroups with headcount planning, tool usage and operational sustainability.

**5. Mitigating Risks and Addressing Crises Proactively.** Qubic faces a variety of internal and external legal risks, regulatory changes and other disruptions that can derail progress if unaddressed. SFO develops risk management frameworks, gives legal counsel and creates contingency plans. They keep a pulse on potential issues, allocating resources and coordinating teams to resolve problems before they escalate into major setbacks.

**6. Measuring Performance and Driving Accountability.** Without transparent metrics and accountability structures, teams may lose focus or underperform against key objectives. SFO implements frameworks (like OKRs) and dashboards that track progress against milestones. By holding regular reviews and communicating results, we ensure that every workgroup remains aligned and responsible for delivering on commitments.

## SFO Q1 Review - Wins & Learnings

- Close to 80% of the Q1 roadmap is completed. QCS completed 90% of the Q1 roadmap with the exception of the Qubic Academy and the delivery of a T2 US exchange (pending from Q4, 2025). Our roadmap is considerably ambitious and the ultimate goal of what we would like to achieve. Reviews are planned to discuss the Q2/3/4 roadmap and add changes were needed.

- We established a legal entity in the Seychelles allowing Qubic to sign contracts and close agreements. The first agreements are signed and the entity is fully operational. In Q2 we’ll continue to explore opportunities to put Qubic in the most beneficial regulatory frameworks. North-America is becoming more crypto friendly and we’re investigating if Qubic “made in America” would offer direct advantages. The entity in Switzerland is put on hold until further notice.

- Successfully supported the ecosystem team with creating a legal framework that will allow it to engage with market makers and other strategic investors. In Q2 SOF will continue to offer legal, risk management and problem solving support across workgroups.

- Strategic launch of the S2 Qubican Ambassador Program, expanding from one global community to 6 local communities (France, USA, Spain, Turkey, Nigeria, Nomads) with a 7th community (Germany) in the works. This season the program further professionalized with the arrival of Community Leads, local events, hackathon support, mentorship from QCS leads and the creation of a playbook to create automatisms. In Q2 we aim to further expand the program into other locations (SEA and NA) and to double down on building strategic relationships with several universities.

- Increased visibility of the Qubic ecosystem by organizing the Qubic ecosystem all-hands. At peak we had 120 Discord members join each all-hands , with 80 members as a low. The team also organized various X Spaces and in prompt DC stages to talk about the Discord. In Q2, we aim to expand Qubic and QCS visibility by organizing public monthly/quarterly business reviews and organizing co-organized community X spaces with for example ambassadors.

- Supported various workgroups to execute on the roadmap; madhack, strategy meetings, CCF proposals, hiring, media appearances and legal counsel. In Q2, we continue with providing the same support.

---

### Learnings

- The incorporation of the entity took too long and has hindered the progression of signing contracts significantly.  
- Data collecting and metrics tracking is still a manual process. With the arrival of qubic metrics and elastic search there’s light at the end of the tunnel.  
- The collaboration with QCT improved significantly with madhack and the delivery of the roadmap being the prime example.
