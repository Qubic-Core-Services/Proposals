## Details

We have been actively looking to recruit a new Community Management Lead to succeed Tom55 who will be focussing on other topics in Qubic. 

We are very glad to announce that after interviewing over a dozen candidates, we have found the ideal candidate in El_Clip. El_Clip was interviewed by both members from QCT (JoeTom) and QCS.

### Here’s a short introduction of the candidate:

El_Clip is an accomplished community manager and a well known community member to the Qubic community. He has successfully managed and grew the Qubic Telegram server. Together with Salar and Braven, El_Clip has been one of the founding members of the arbitrator committee which manages challenging community issues like TOs and bans. Furthermore El_Clip has been one of the driving forces of building the Spanish Qubic Community and their Qubican ambassador program. 

What we like about El_Clip is his passion for Qubic, his problem solving skills and his ability to stay calm under pressure. He understands that community management requires patience and dialogue, skills that he has proven to possess over a longer period of time.  
We firmly believe that El_Clip would add tremendous value as he joins the QCS Committee and will represent the voice of many community members too. 

El_Clip will join Qubic Core Services as the Community Management Lead. He will be responsible for hiring, supervising, coaching, and supporting the mods and community supporters, engaging with discord admins in order to implement improvements and changes in the server setup. He will design and execute comprehensive community engagement strategies that attract new members and retain existing ones. Serve as the voice of the community in internal discussions, representing community needs, feedback, and trends to the QCS Committee. Lastly he will be responsible to proactively identify potential community conflicts or crises and formulate mitigation strategies together with the community arbitrator committee. 

As part of the proposal we would like to transfer ownership of Telegram to El Clip. Yigit will replace El_Clip as one of the three arbitrator committee members.

The Qubic Core Services Committee is extremely pleased with the outcome of this process and invites everyone to participate in the conversation and to vote in favor of electing El_Clip as the new Community Management Lead.

### 以下是候选人的简短介绍：

El_Clip 是一位经验丰富的社区经理，也是 Qubic 社区的知名社区成员。他成功地管理和发展了 Qubic Telegram 服务器。 El_Clip 与 Salar 和 Braven 一起，是仲裁委员会的创始成员之一，该委员会负责管理 TO 和禁令等具有挑战性的社区问题。此外，El_Clip 还是建立西班牙 Qubic 社区及其 Qubican 大使计划的推动力之一。

作为提案的一部分，我们希望将 Telegram 的所有权转让给 El Clip。Yigit 将取代 El_Clip 成为三名仲裁委员会成员之一。

Qubic 核心服务委员会对这一过程的结果非常满意，并邀请所有人参与对话并投票支持选举 El_Clip 为新的社区管理负责人。
