### Proposal

**Available Options:**  
- **Option 0:** No, I don’t want  
- **Option 1:** Yes, approve the requested 13,75B Qubic  

### Details

We have the opportunity to list **QUBIC** on **LBank** ([LBank on CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/lbank/)) under the following conditions:

#### **Costs**
- **$22,000** for listing  

LBank is an exchange ranked **#17** on CoinMarketCap. The exchange is based in the **British Virgin Islands** and is owned and operated by **LBK Blockchain Co., Limited**. It also has offices in **Lithuania, Canada, and Singapore**.

For other tokens like **KAS**, LBank provides a daily trading volume exceeding **$10M**, which could be beneficial for increasing **QUBIC’s** daily trading volume.

For this reason, we are requesting **$22K in QUBIC** at the current price of **$1600 per billion**.  
_All funds will be used for the listing, and in case of a price increase in QUBIC, the excess funds will be returned to the CCF._

### **Listing Costs**
- **Amount:** 13.75 bln QUBIC @1600/bln, around **$22,000**
- **Timeline:** 4 weeks after payment for the **QUBIC** integration on spot
